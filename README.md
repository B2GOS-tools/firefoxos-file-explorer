FirefoxOS File Explorer
=======================

This is an open source file explorer, for FirefoxOS devices. The intention of this project is to give the FirefoxOS user the capability to navigate through his/her SD card files, and to delete/create files (this is not possible with basic firmware). 

Many parts of the code can surely be enhanced, any help would be appreciated. Any developer interested in contributing, please, send me an e-mail to ils@tid.es
